A guiding fitness app for people willing to adopt a healthier lifestyle. 

The High Fidelity prototype of our interactive app was created using Adobe XD. The Low Fidelity prototype along with the necessary ideations & information architectures, which shaped our app to its present form, were created using Miro & Figma. The project also involved collecting requirement gatherings, conducting regular surveys and evaluations.
